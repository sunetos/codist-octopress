<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing" target="_blank">Hill climb algorithms</a> are some of the simplest in artificial intelligence. A hill climb algorithm quickly finds a local maximum from a random starting position. I have developed a few variations of the basic algorithm in Javascript as well as a visualization tool to see how they work.</p>
<p>. There are a few variations shown here, including:</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Steepest Ascent</strong>: heads in the direction of the greatest improvement over the current position.</li>
<li> <strong>Random Restart</strong>: keeps trying random positions until there has been no improvement for several attempts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hill Climb Visualization</h3>
