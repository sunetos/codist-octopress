<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Curve3D is an open-source cross-browser 3D engine written in pure javascript. It works in all major current browsers (Firefox 3.6+, IE8+,  Chrome 5+, Opera 10.5+). Curve3D includes a high performance math  library, significantly faster than other javascript matrix math  libraries currently available.</p>
<p>Curve3D is uniquely powerful for a pure javascript 3D engine. It is  the only 3D engine that works natively in Internet Explorer (I could not  find any others as of June 2010). It includes multiple render methods,  including a pure CSS3 renderer, a pure canvas tag renderer, and a hybrid  canvas/CSS3 renderer. It also supports switching the renderer on the  fly.</p>
<p>The code is released under the New BSD license, and the source is available at <a href="http://github.com/sunetos/curve3d">the github project page.</a></p>
